# Approximation-Algorithms-for-MESP

There are three approximation algorithms for solving maximum entropy sampling problem (MESP): greedy, local search and randomized sampling, which correspond to files greedy.py, local_search.py and randomized.py, respectively. Further, in the user.py file, we input the covariance matrix, carry out data preprocessing and define functions. In the frank_wolfe.py file, we implement the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to solve an upper bound for MESP. In particular, runing the local search algorithm needs to import greedy.py; runing the Frank-Wolfe algorithm needs to import local_search.py; runing the randomized sampling algorithm needs to import frank_wolfe.py;
